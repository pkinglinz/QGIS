class QgsServerFilter
{
%Docstring
Class defining I/O filters for QGIS Server and
implemented in plugins.

Filters can define any (or none) of the following hooks:
* requestReady() - called when request is ready
* responseComplete() - called when the response is complete
after core services have returned to main loop
* sendResponse() - called just before sending output to FGCI
%End

%TypeHeaderCode
#include "qgsserverfilter.h"
%End
  public:

    QgsServerFilter( QgsServerInterface *serverInterface );
%Docstring
Constructor
QgsServerInterface passed to plugins constructors
and must be passed to QgsServerFilter instances.
%End

    virtual ~QgsServerFilter();

    QgsServerInterface *serverInterface();
%Docstring
Returns the QgsServerInterface instance
%End

    virtual void requestReady();
%Docstring
Method called when the QgsRequestHandler is ready and populated with
parameters, just before entering the main switch for core services.*
%End

    virtual void responseComplete();
%Docstring
Method called when the QgsRequestHandler processing has done and
the response is ready, just after the main switch for core services
and before final sending response to FCGI stdout.
%End

    virtual void sendResponse();
%Docstring
Method called when the QgsRequestHandler sends its data to FCGI stdout.
This normally occurs at the end of core services processing just after
the responseComplete() plugin hook. For streaming services (like WFS on
getFeature requests, sendResponse() might have been called several times
before the response is complete: in this particular case, sendResponse()
is called once for each feature before hitting responseComplete()
%End
